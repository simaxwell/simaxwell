👋 Hello, my name is Si Maxwell. I am a professionally recognised government data analyst and statistician.

🥾 I'm a big fan of the statistical programming language R, hiking and trail running.

📚 I studied earth science at university, finishing my PhD in 2018.

🦍 My PhD involved a quality assurance assessment of the ape and human fossil record. Using phylogenetic and statistical methods, I challenged the view that their fossil record is an accurate archive of evolutionary events.

🚜 In 2020, I joined the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, developing statistics on price inflation in agriculture.

🌳 In 2022, I joined [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/), the research agency of the Forestry Commission, Great Britain's principal organisation for forestry and tree-related research. Here I report on environmental and social aspects of forestry, including rates of new tree planting, UK woodland area, and public opinion of woodlands and trees. I offer statistical support on economic aspects of forestry and am responsible for the UK's international reporting obligations.
