ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Si Maxwell.

ðŸŒ³ I am a statistician at [Forest Research](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/), the research agency of the Forestry Commission, Great Britain's principal organisation for forestry and tree-related research.

ðŸ¥¾ I'm a fan of R, hiking and trail running.

ðŸ“š I studied earth science at university, finishing my PhD in 2018.

ðŸšœ In 2020, I joined the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, developing statistics on price inflation in agriculture.
